## Review Issues & PRs

### New

* **PR #114 Alignment of info, servers objects and security scope names (Rafal DT)** ([PR #114](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/114))
  * Opened on 2024/07/22.  For both Match and Fill-in. 
  * **[July 23rd]** This PR is for alignment with Commonalities v0.4, and needs to be approved and merged for Meta-release Fall24.
  * Together with PR #115 and PR #111, this needs to be approved and merged within this week, in order to meet Meta-release Fall24 M3 deadline.  <br>->To meet this deadline, **this PR should be reviewed within 48 hours after the meeting ends**.
    <br>-> **All to review the PR #114 by 48 hours after the meeting ends.** **AI #19.01 (All)**

* **PR #115 KYC-Match: Error responses alignment with Commonalities (Rafal DT)** ([PR #115](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/115))
  * Opened on 2024/07/22.
  * For Match only. Is the same content required for Fill-in?
  * **[July 23rd]** This PR proposes to add Device Object-related requirements to the API specification, however, the proposal has not been approved in Commonalities, so, this PR need not be approved and merged for Meta-release Fall24 from the perspective of Commonalities alignment. Commonalities WG is supposed to approve this proposal for Mete-release Spring25, so, we could postpone this proposal till Spring25 as well.
  * Jorge TEF: we should decide this to be approved and merged or not, by end of this week, to meet Fall24 Meta-release M3 deadline. 
   <br>-> Toshi KDDI: Is it possible for us to make the preliminal decidion by end of this week, and then to correct it by a PR by M4 deadline, if needed? 
   <br>-> Jorge TEF: That would not be a simple correction, so, it is not possible.
   <br>-> Toshi KDDI: Understood. Let's open for comments for 48 hours after the meeting ends, and then decide.
   <br>-> **All to review the PR #115 by 48 hours after the meeting ends.** **AI #19.02 (All)**

* **Issue #116 KYC Fill-in Readiness Checklist (Toshi KDDI)** ([Issue #116](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/116))
  * Opened on 2024/07/23.
  * Corresponding to Issue #104 for Match.
  * **[July 23rd]** This PR is to proceed with Fill-in API Fall 24 Mete-release, same as Match v0.2. 
    <br>->Jorge TEF: Version number needs to be changed from v0.1 to v0.1-rc1, as Herbert pointed out.

  * Discussion ongoing
  * **[July 23rd]** Jorge TEF: There are two points to be decided today. <br>(1) MatchScoreResult integer or float, <br>(2) Scoring provides numbers only, and how to understand numbers is left to developers, assuming Jaro-Winkler algorithm is used.
  * **(1) Agreed: interger.** <br>-> Huub KPN: ok for interger, if it is KYC SP's decision. However, from KPN's experience of Mobile Connect, it may be changed to float in future.
  * **(2) Agreed: Scoring provides numbers only.** <br>->Huub KPN: KPN is providing Match Scoring, and KPN leaves it (how to understand numbers) to customers (developers, API users), because requirements are different from each customer.  KPN provides some supporting documents which are not included in API description.  Regarding Normalisation, it should be done locally (by each country / operator), as it is different from countries and langugages.  
  * Geroge DT: who joined the meeting for the first time, made some questions on Match Scoring, Privacy issues and so on, which were answered by KYC SP members.
